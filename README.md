# UNP_PROJECT_PREDICTIVE_ANAYLSIS_OF_CROP_YIELD

This project was developed as a group assignment under the guidance of unp education. 
By examining important agriculture variables like crop type and region, this project uses machine learning to predict crop yield. To make precise predictions, a random forest regressor is trained after the dataset has been cleaned and prepared using label encoding and feature scaling. The mean squared error(MSE) and R2 score are used to evaluate the model's performance, and feature imporatance anaylsis identifies the variables that have the biggest effects on yield. In order to prepare if for deployment or further research, the project also contains visualizations and a saved model (crop_yield_model.pkl).
